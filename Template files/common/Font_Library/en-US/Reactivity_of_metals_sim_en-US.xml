        <source>Cu is less reactive than Al. So it cannot displace the metals from their salt solutions.</source>

        <source>Al is more reactive than Zn, Fe &amp; Cu. So it displaces these metals from ZnSO4, FeSO4 &amp; CuSO4 solutions.</source>

        <source>Zn is more reactive than Fe,Cu. So it can displace these metals from FeSO4, CuSO4 solution respectively. Zn is less reactive than Al so it can&apos;t displace Al from Al2(SO4)3.</source>

        <source>Cu is more reactive than Zn,Fe,Al. So it can&apos;t displace these metals from those salt solution.

        <source>Zn is more reactive than Cu/Fe and it can displace Cu/Fe from CuSO4/FeSO4 solution to form a colourless solution of (ZnSO4).No change is observed in Al2(SO4)3.</source>

      <trans-unit id="018" resname="IDS_IRON_AL_ZN">
        <source>There is no change. This indicates that Fe is less reactive than the other two metals Al and Zn so it cannot displace these metals from their salt solutions.</source>

      <trans-unit id="019" resname="IDS_IRON_COPPER">
        <source>Fe is more reactive than Cu and it can displace Cu from CuSO4 solution and form a light green coloured FeSO4 solution.</source>

        <source>No change is observed. Because Zn is less reactive than Al so it cannot displace Al from Al2(SO4)3 solution.</source>
